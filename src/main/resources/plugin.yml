description:
  "
§aHole in the Floor §fuses a completely different PvP system than any other PvP map.
Your only weapon in this map is a fishing rod §c(and powerups of course)§f, 
you can punch and drag other players with your fishing rod to make them fall through the hole, 
which is in the middle of every battlefield. If that happens they'll lose a life.
You also have a §clifetime §fbar which slowly decreases over time.
If you run out of lifetime you will also die, but you can easily regain lifetime, by jumping over the hole!
