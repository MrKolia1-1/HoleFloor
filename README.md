✧ Special PvP Mechanics
Hole in the Floor uses a completely different PvP system than any other PvP map. Your only weapon in this map is a fishing rod (and powerups of course), you can punch and drag other players with your fishing rod to make them fall through the hole, which is in the middle of every battlefield. If that happens they'll lose a life. You also have a "lifetime" bar which slowly decreases over time. If you run out of lifetime you will also die, but you can easily regain lifetime, by jumping over the hole!

✧ Customizable Options
In Floor 2 you can also changes things like lives, powerups and lifetime! With the options in Floor you can change the game to be exactly like you want it to be!

✧ Tons of Powerups
To spice up the gameplay even more Floor features a great variety of custom powerups. There are several tiers of powerups with increasing rarity and power! Powerups spawn in the middle of the map, just above the hole in the floor and make it very tempting to jump over the hole (even when not considering lifetime), so you can both use the powerups for... well powerups, but also as an opportunity to drag other players into the hole!

✧ Several Arenas
The many arenas in this map also make sure it doesn't get boring quickly. Each arena has a different layout and its own quirks!
